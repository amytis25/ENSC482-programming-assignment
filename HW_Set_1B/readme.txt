HW Set 1 (B)

The programming assignments for this homework set were the following: 
Programming Assignment 1 (20) - Write a program in a programming language of your choice that takes as input a two-player normal-form game and computes the Nash equilibrium(s) for that game.  
Programming Assignment 2 (30) - Write a program in a programming language of your choice that takes as input a two-player normal-form game and computes the mixed Nash equilibrium for that game. Graphically visualize the solution.  

For this homework set, both programming assignments were completed using MATLAB R2025a, using no additional libraries.

The same files and videos are included in both folders, with an additional image in the Programming_Assignment_2 folder named graphical visualization which is the graphical visualization asked for in the question.
