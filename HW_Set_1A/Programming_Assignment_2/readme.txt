HW Set 1 (A) - Programming Assignment 2

The programming assignment covered in this folder is the following: 
Programing Assignment 2 (20) – Show the results of a sorting algorithm, (e.g. in C++ https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/sorting-techniques-in-cpp/  , or in C# https://dotnetcoretutorials.com/2020/05/10/basic-sorting-algorithms-in-c/ , or …) using two examples. For one of the examples, sort your short-shopping list using the first alphabet of each item (i.e. A=1, B=2, C=3, …). The other example is to sort and stack 4 blocks according to their R value in their RGB color deceleration. Use OpenGL or Unity to visualize the blocks. The initial screen is the user specified colors of the random stackof block and the final screen is the sorted stack. Supply the source code and sample results. 


This assignment was done using Python, OpenGL, pygame, and the random library to generate random colours for the cubes.
OpenGL and pygame were installed using (note installation of python is necessary previous to this step):
 pip install pygame
and 
 pip install PyOpenGL PyOpenGL_accelerate

The assignment file is called prob2.py and it can be run through terminal using the command "python prob2.py".
