HW Set 1 (A) - Programming Assignment 3

The programming assignment covered in this folder is the following: 
Programing Assignment 3 (50) â€“ Write a program which determines which act(s) should be chosen in the decision problem below according to each of the following decision rule: (a) The maximin rule; (b) maximax; (c) minimax regret; (d) the optimism-pessimism rule (for alph > .25) and (e) the principle of insufficient reason.  
The 4 by 4 decision matrix is defined by the following row vectors corresponding to each of the acts: a1=(20, 20, 0, 10); a2=(10, 10, 10, 10); a3=(0, 40, 0, 0); a4=(10, 30, 0, 0). For each of the decision rules, supply the commented source code (with instructions on how to link and compile) and sample results.

This programming assignment was completed using MATLAB R2025a, using no additional libraries. With installation of MATLAB you can just open the prob3.m files and press run in editor to run the program. The results should appear in the terminal.
